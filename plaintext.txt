Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers
Betty Botter bought some butter
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood
She sells seashells by the seashore
How can a clam cram in a clean cream can
I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream
I saw Susie sitting in a shoeshine shop
I saw a kitten eating chicken in the kitchen
If a dog chews shoes, whose shoes does he choose
I wish to wash my Irish wristwatch
A skunk sat on a stump and thunk the stump stunk, but the stump thunk the skunk stunk
Lesser leather never weathered wetter weather better
