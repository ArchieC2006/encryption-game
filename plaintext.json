  "A": "I met a traveller from an antique land,\nWho said, \"Two vast and trunkless legs of stone\nStand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,\nHalf sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\nAnd wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\nTell that its sculptor well those passions read\nWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\nThe hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;\nAnd on the pedestal these words appear:\n'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:\nLook on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'\nNothing beside remains. Round the decay\nOf that Colossal Wreck, boundless and bare,\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away.\"",
  "B": "In Flanders fields the poppies blow\nBetween the crosses, row on row,\nThat mark our place; and in the sky\nThe larks, still bravely singing, fly\nScarce heard amid the guns below.\n\nWe are the Dead.\nShort days ago\nWe lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,\nLoved and were loved, and now we lie\nIn Flanders fields.\n\nTake up our quarrel with the foe:\nTo you from failing hands we throw\nThe torch; be yours to hold it high.\nIf ye break faith with us who die\nWe shall not sleep, though poppies grow\nIn Flanders fields.",
  "C": "Tyger Tyger, burning bright,\nIn the forests of the night;\nWhat immortal hand or eye,\nCould frame thy fearful symmetry?\nIn what distant deeps or skies.\nBurnt the fire of thine eyes?\nOn what wings dare he aspire?\nWhat the hand, dare seize the fire?\nAnd what shoulder, & what art,\nCould twist the sinews of thy heart?\nAnd when thy heart began to beat,\nWhat dread hand? & what dread feet?\nWhat the hammer? what the chain,\nIn what furnace was thy brain?\nWhat the anvil? what dread grasp,\nDare its deadly terrors clasp!\nWhen the stars threw down their spears\nAnd water'd heaven with their tears:\nDid he smile his work to see?\nDid he who made the Lamb make thee?\nTyger Tyger burning bright,\nIn the forests of the night:\nWhat immortal hand or eye,\nDare frame thy fearful symmetry?"
